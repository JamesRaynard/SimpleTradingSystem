Simple Trading System
=====================

This was written purely as a programming exercise. This system is NOT intended to be traded.
All results are simulated and would not be achievable in practice. Trading this system is NOT
likely to prove profitable and I accept no responsibility for any losses that may occur.

The system uses two moving average crossovers to generate signals. (An n-day moving average
is simply the arithmetic mean of the prices over the previous n days). A buy signal occurs
when the "faster" moving average, i.e. the one with the shorter period, crosses over the
"slower" moving average, i.e. the one with the longer period. Similarly, a sell signal
occurs when the faster moving average crosses under the slower moving average.

When a buy signal occurs, a long position is opened in the instrument whose trade we are
simulating; this could be a stock, commodity future, investment fund and so on. When
a sell signal occurs, a short position is opened in the instrument. Any positions which
were already open due to an earlier signal are closed.

The core of the system is in processor/Processor.java

All the parameters of the system may be configured; this is achieved by modifying the
appropriate values in the constants folder.

Simple and exponential moving averages are provided. Other types may be added by subclassing
MovingAverage, which may be found in the averages folder.

The criterion for creating buy and sell signals may be altered by editing
critera/MovingAverageCritera.java
